# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office
<p>In these projects, I will use what I learned from my Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python courses from <b>Datacamp</b> to solve real-world problems in data science. I will find out if movies on Netflix are getting shorter and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of The Office, by using techniques like lists, loops, pandas, and matplotlib.<p>
<p>
This project will give me the opportunity to practice an important skill in data science called exploratory data analysis. This involves working with raw data and making important conclusions based on the plots I create from the data.<p>
